Welcome! I am Abu Adnan Sadi. I am currently working as a research assistant at North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my B.Sc. in computer science and engineering from North South University. My research interest is primarily in areas related to natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and computer vision. I also have an interest in the healthcare informatics domain. My current research is primarily centered around NLP and its application in the healthcare domain.
