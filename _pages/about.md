Welcome! I am Abu Adnan Sadi. I am currently working as a research assistant at North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I completed my B.Sc. in computer science and engineering from North South University. My research interest is primarily in areas related to natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and computer vision. I am particularly interested in research related to the application of AI in the healthcare domain. My current research focuses on developing an NLP-based tool for performing disease diagnosis from medical text.
